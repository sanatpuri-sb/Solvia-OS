# üöÄ Solvia Bootstrap Plan (Day 1‚Äì2) ‚Äî From Zero to Claude MCP Handoff

> Goal: Minimize manual window. In ~1‚Äì2 days, bring up **persistent memory**, **MCP runtime**,
> **vector search**, **automation (n8n)**, **CI guardrails**, then run one smoke test and hand off
> execution to Claude MCP.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites (once-only)

- [x] GitHub account with a new repo (created `Solvia-OS`)
- [x] macOS with admin rights
- [ ] Claude Desktop installed (for **MCP** runtime)
- [ ] GPT-4o API key (Day 1; assists reasoning/multimodal alongside Claude MCP)
- [ ] Node 20+ (for CI scripts)

> **Prereq Deltas (2025-08-13):**
>
> - Using **Public** repo to enable branch protection on Free plan (org-only restrictions not
>   available on personal accounts).
> - **GPT-4o API key** not set yet ‚Üí Step C uses **local embeddings** as a temporary workaround.
> - **Node 20+** not installed yet ‚Üí required before Step D (CI).
> - **Claude Desktop** not installed yet ‚Üí required before Step F (MCP runtime).
> - Authoring aid: VS Code **AI inline completions** (e.g., GitHub Copilot) is enabled. Treat
>   suggestions as drafts; structure enforced by CI in Step D.

## 1) Create Canonical Repo Structure (10 min)

Create folders and seed files. **GitHub is the only writable source of truth.** Others mirror
read-only.

/docs/ master_plan.md bootstrap.md /memory/ identity.yaml goals.yaml beliefs.yaml tasks.yaml
contradictions.yaml decisions.md metrics.yaml /proposals/ /logs/ /automation/ /workflows Note:
`/automation` and `/workflows` are operational folders for automation configs and workflow exports,
not part of core memory.

**Go/No-Go A**

- [x] All folders exist and render on GitHub
- [x] Day-1 memory files exist (minimal)

---

## 2) Seed Day-1 Memory (20‚Äì30 min)

Populate minimal, valid entries:

- `identity.yaml`: owner, values, tone, canonical_store=github
- `goals.yaml`: Q/M/W with 1 top goal ID (e.g., `G-2025Q3-OPS`)
- `beliefs.yaml`: 2‚Äì3 beliefs with IDs (`B-0001‚Ä¶`)
- `tasks.yaml`: at least 1 task linking to a goal/belief (use IDs like `T-0001`)
- `contradictions.yaml`: start empty or add one known risk
- `decisions.md`: a short entry stating GitHub is canonical
- `metrics.yaml`: keys present, values can be null

**Go/No-Go B**

- [x] Day-1 files commit cleanly; IDs (`G-‚Ä¶`, `B-‚Ä¶`, `T-‚Ä¶`, `C-‚Ä¶`) are present where relevant
- [ ] No schema/format errors (we‚Äôll enforce in ¬ß4)

---

## 3) Bring Up Vector Memory (Chroma) (30‚Äì45 min)

Purpose: eliminate session amnesia immediately.

- [x] Start Chroma (local)
- [x] Index `/memory/**` + `/docs/master_plan.md`
- [x] Save an indexing script/config under `/automation/` (`index_repo.py`, `index_config.md`)
- [x] Confirm policy note: indexing is manual for now; incremental re-embedding can be added later
- [x] `.gitignore` excludes the local vector DB at `automation/chroma/`

> **C Delta (2025-08-13):** Due to OpenAI quota, embeddings switched to **local** >
> `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.  
> `index_repo.py` auto-falls back to local if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing or
> `USE_LOCAL_EMBEDDINGS=1`.  
> We will revisit OpenAI embeddings once billing is enabled.

**Go/No-Go C**

- [x] Ask your assistant a question requiring both `goals.yaml` and `master_plan.md` _(satisfied via
      programmatic retrieval: Chroma shows chunks from both)_
- [x] Verify answer cites both (files/IDs). No manual paste used.

---

## 4) Fail-Closed Governance (CI) (30 min)

Purpose: prevent phantom files & drift.

**Editor validation (schema hints)**

- [x] Add `.vscode/settings.json` in repo root to map YAML files ‚Üí JSON Schemas
- [x] Confirm VS Code shows red squiggles on bad keys/IDs

> **D Delta (2025-08-13):** While CI is not yet configured, branch protection is **PR-only with
> linear history**;  
> ‚ÄúRequire approvals‚Äù and ‚ÄúRequire status checks‚Äù are **temporarily disabled** to allow solo
> merges.  
> They must be **re-enabled** immediately after CI is added in this step.

- [x] Add a GitHub Action workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that enforces:
- YAML lint + JSON-schema checks (at least structure & required keys); include `decisions.md`
  Markdown lint for broken headings/links
- Path allow-list strictly enforced (deny writes outside `/memory`, `/docs`, `/proposals`, `/logs`,
  `/automation`)
- Referential integrity (e.g., `tasks.links.beliefs` exist)
- ID format checks for `G-`, `B-`, `T-`, `C-` where applicable
- [x] Add `.vscode/settings.json` schema mappings for YAML files
- [x] Verify VS Code validation works (introduce a fake key in `memory/tasks.yaml` ‚Üí red squiggle
      appears)
- [x] Mark invalid PRs as **fail** (no merge)
- [x] Main branch must be protected in GitHub settings; require CI pass before merge
- [x] Branch protection ‚Üí Required status checks: add **`validate`** (use the exact name shown in
      your PR Checks)
- [x] Re-enable **Require status checks to pass before merging** (after CI is green on `main`)
- [ ] Re-enable **Require approvals (1)** (solo-friendly only when a second account can review)

_(If you don‚Äôt have scripts yet, stub the job to at least lint YAML + deny unknown paths; you can
harden later.)_

**Go/No-Go D**

- [x] Intentionally break a key in `tasks.yaml` on a PR ‚Üí CI blocks merge
- [x] Local editor shows schema errors (bad key in `tasks.yaml` squiggled) before CI runs

### 4.1 D+1 Hardening Actions (to schedule)

- - [x] Expand markdownlint scope back to `docs/**/*.md` with config in `.markdownlint.json` at repo
        root
- [x] Add proposal schema at `automation/schemas/proposal.schema.json` and validate
      `/proposals/**/*.yaml` in CI (schema in `automation/schemas/`, proposals under `proposals/`)
- [ ] Add a CI job to auto-format Markdown (Prettier) before enforcing strict markdownlint ‚üµ (keep
      scheduled; optional if relaxed rules suffice)
- [x] Add status check aliasing (if job name changes, update Branch Protection to match current
      check name)
- [ ] Enable **Require approvals (1)** after a second reviewer (or Org) is available

---

## 5) Configure Automation Engine (n8n) (45‚Äì60 min)

Purpose: close loops without you as glue.

- [ ] Run n8n (Docker or local)
- [ ] Create 2 simple workflows:

1. **Proposals Cron (daily)**: read repo ‚Üí write a tiny, valid proposal to `/proposals` ‚Üí open a PR
2. **Mirror Sync (optional)**: push read-only views (tasks/beliefs/goals) to Notion/Obsidian/Asana

- [ ] Store secrets in n8n credentials (never in repo)
- [ ] Enforce in workflows: write only to `/proposals/` (open PR); never commit directly to main
- [ ] Confirm main-branch protection in GitHub blocks direct pushes and requires CI pass
- [ ] Workflow exports saved under `/workflows`

**Go/No-Go E**

- [ ] Manually trigger Proposals Cron ‚Üí a PR appears with a trivial, valid change (e.g., a new tag
      in `identity.yaml`)

---

## 6) Configure Claude MCP Runtime (30‚Äì45 min)

Purpose: give the model direct file/tool access without copy-paste.

- [ ] Enable MCP Filesystem scoped to your repo folder
- [ ] Verify Claude Desktop is configured to use the same repo folder as MCP root; test read/write
      permissions on allowed paths
- [ ] Allowed paths: read/write `/memory`, `/docs`, `/proposals`; append-only `/logs`
- [ ] Policy: Claude MCP writes to `/proposals` (no direct main-branch writes); GPT-4o may assist
      reasoning but has no file access
- [ ] (Optional) Expose a small HTTP tool for **retrieve_context** ‚Üí returns a context pack from
      vector store

**Go/No-Go F**

- [ ] In Claude: ‚ÄúOpen `identity.yaml` ‚Üí prepare a proposal to add a minor key (e.g.,
      `docs.master_plan=/docs/master_plan.md`)‚Äù
- [ ] Confirm a PR lands; CI passes
- [ ] In the same Claude session, call `retrieve_context` (or read embeddings via tool) and then
      open a PR; both must succeed

---

## 7) First End-to-End Smoke (10‚Äì15 min)

Run this **in one Claude session**:

1. **Read**: load `master_plan.md` + `goals.yaml`
2. **Retrieve**: fetch related beliefs for the top goal and cite file paths/IDs
3. **Propose**: add or link one task in `tasks.yaml`; open PR to `/proposals`
4. **Validate**: ensure CI passes and links resolve
5. **Reflect**: append a short decision entry in `decisions.md` referencing the PR

**Go/No-Go G**

- [ ] All five steps succeed without manual paste

---

## 8) Handoff to Claude MCP (final switch)

When A‚ÄìG are green:

- **Day-to-day lives in Claude MCP** (Operator).
- Keep this chat (SolviaLite) only for **architecture debates** or major plan revisions.
- Use n8n for cron jobs & deterministic workflows; keep mirrors read-only.
- Ensure `/docs/master_plan.md` and `/docs/bootstrap.md` are up to date in the repo before
  switching.
- Ensure `/workflows` and `/automation/index_config.md` are committed

---

## üîí Guardrails that keep you safe

- GitHub is the **single writable source**; mirrors are **read-only**
- CI blocks invalid structure/paths/links
- CI guardrails are defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and block invalid proposals before merge
- PRs only from `/proposals`; no direct edits to main
- Keep **IDs stable** (`G-‚Ä¶`, `B-‚Ä¶`, `T-‚Ä¶`, `C-‚Ä¶`) to avoid link rot
- MCP runtime must never be allowed to bypass proposal workflow ‚Äî disable direct main-branch writes
  at the GitHub repo level
- Automation and MCP must operate PR-only; direct edits to main are prohibited and blocked by branch
  protection
- Maintain at least one local or remote backup clone for repo recovery; if the main repo is
  corrupted, restore from backup and re-run CI

---

## üßØ Rollback (if something breaks)

- Revert the PR that caused the failure (GitHub ‚ÄúRevert‚Äù)
- If vector retrieval corrupts, re-index from clean repo state
- If n8n fails, disable the affected workflow; re-enable after fix
- If MCP writes to the wrong path, reduce its allowed paths and retry

---

## üìå Scope boundaries (to avoid overbuilding)

**Not required before handoff:**

- LangChain/CrewAI (save for Week 6+)
- Custom Python ETL (unless MCP+n8n cannot cover)
- Two-way Notion/Asana sync
- A custom UI/control panel

---

## üß™ Quick Checklists (copy into issues)

**Issue: ‚ÄúBootstrap A‚ÄìG Go/No-Go‚Äù**

- [x] A Repo structure ‚úî
- [x] B Day-1 memory seeded ‚úî
- [x] C Vector retrieval ‚úî (local embeddings)
- [x] D CI fail-closed ‚úî
- [ ] E n8n PR appears ‚úî
- [ ] F MCP proposal PR ‚úî
- [ ] G Smoke test (read‚Üíretrieve‚Üípropose‚Üívalidate‚Üíreflect) ‚úî

**Issue: ‚ÄúMirrors Read-Only Confirmed‚Äù**

- [ ] Notion/Obsidian/Asana pull only
- [ ] Edits blocked or overwritten on next sync

---

## üìé Notes

- `decisions.md` is Markdown for narrative clarity; all other core memory is YAML for strict
  structure.
- Keep all schema/doc choices **inside the repo**, so any assistant (Claude/GPT) can pick up
  instantly with zero paste.
- VS Code AI inline completions (e.g., GitHub Copilot) are enabled for YAML authoring; structure
  enforced via schema hints and CI.
