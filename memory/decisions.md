# Decisions
- 2025-08-13: GitHub is canonical; mirrors read-only; proposals via /proposals.
- 2025-08-13: Chroma online (local embeddings). Branch protection PR-only; status checks/approvals off until CI (Step D).
- 2025-08-13: Repo kept Public to enable branch protection on a personal plan; plan to migrate to a GitHub Organization and make Private later.
- 2025-08-13: Switched vector embeddings to local `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` due to API quota (429). Will re-evaluate after CI and billing.
- 2025-08-14: Authored initial memory files with AI inline completions (Copilot) for speed; content treated as drafts pending CI schema validation (Step D).
