    proposed_fix:
      "Keep approvals off until a second reviewer account exists or org repo is
      used; rely on CI + branch protection (required checks, linear history).
      Revisit after MCP handoff."

      "The repo contains automation configs and schema mappings the operator
      does not fully understand."
    risk:
      "Future changes may break CI or automation workflows without operator
      recognizing cause."
    mitigation:
      "Rely on fail-closed CI and later add automation self-healing to
      adjust/fix configs."
